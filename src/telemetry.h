// The applications can be configured to provide a verbose real-time
// telemetry stream. Output is filtered using the corresponding log
// level macro.

// Each line of output is a single telemetry record. Telemetry records
// are comma-delimited and are all of the form
//
//        <type>,<data>,...,
//
// where <type> is an 8-bit integer (expressed) in hexadecimal format
// which indicates the type of record i.e. schema of the following data
// fields and their semantics. The type codes are enumerated below.
//
// Application Start
// This record contains no data but simply indicates that a system start
// has occurred. Useful for differentiating app executions in the
// resulting logs.

// - t_d is the dongle clock expressed as a base-10 integer
// - i is the number of the current dongle epoch, also base 10
// - signal_id is an identifier for the associated packet, unique to the

// - addr is the bluetooth address of the advertising device
